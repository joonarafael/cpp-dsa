# Algorithms for Solving Problems

This repository contains my exercise solutions for the "Algorithms for Solving Problems" course.

## C++ Files to Binaries

With the _g++_ tool, compile the selected `x.cpp` file into a binary executable using

```
g++ x.cpp -o ./bin/execute -O2 -Wall
```

You may now run the binary by executing

```
./bin/execute
```
